# GB_Packers
I am a diehard Green Bay Packers fan who also enjoys programming. This project combines my interests. I plan to build a CLI-based Packers tool to find stats, game info and more. I'll likely add a lot of bells and whistles to this project for fun. All of my data is sourced from pro-football-reference.com and is in accordance with their robots.txt policy.

TODO:
* Allow for searching of a certain game (add advanced output, maybe clean up more)
* Allow for easy use in the console (ie: make a build of it)
* Unit tests
* Add stats and dynamic updating (try to keep offline as much as possible)
* Make ascii art logo an option for command

Bells and whistles:
* add sbom
* dependabot auto-merge
