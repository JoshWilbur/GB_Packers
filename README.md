# GB_Packers
I am a diehard Green Bay Packers fan who also enjoys programming. This project combines my interests. I plan to build a CLI-based Packers tool to find stats, game info and more. I'll likely add a lot of bells and whistles to this project for fun.

TODO:
* Make ascii art logo an option for command (--logo)
* Add opponent record
* Add stats and dynamic updating (try to keep offline as much as possible)

Bells and whistles:
* add dependabot
* add sbom
* unit tests
* create a docker container for this?
