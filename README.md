# GB_Packers
I am a diehard Green Bay Packers fan who also enjoys programming. This project combines my interests. I plan to build a CLI-based Packers tool to find stats, game info and more. I'll likely add a lot of bells and whistles to this project for fun. All data is sourced from pro-football-reference.com and is in accordance with their robots.txt policy.

TODO:
* Add receiving, defensive and special teams stats
* Unit testing for scrape_stats.py and nfl_stats.py
* Allow for easy use in the console (ie: turn this into a package)

Bells and whistles:
* add sbom
* Packers ASCII art logo
* Add stadium info (attendance too?)
